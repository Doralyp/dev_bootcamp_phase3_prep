Phase 3 Prep
========================

The main goal of this document is to introduce Phase 3 students to Rails, point out the main differences between Rails and Sinatra, and offer first hand experience and guidance to those making the switch from Sinatra to Rails. 

My Motivation
-------------

After experiencing the seemingly mind shattering shift from Sinatra to Rails, I have decided to create a prep sheet for future [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) boots in hopes of their escaping experiencing my, and the many before me's, same frustrating fate. 


Contirbution is Encouraged
---------------------

For those who would be so kind to contribute to this project please fork, add changes, and do a pull request. The more input the merrier. Let's help give back to DBC and improve the experience and success of those coming after us.
