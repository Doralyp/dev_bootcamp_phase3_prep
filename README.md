Phase 3 Prep
========================

The main goal of this document is to introduce Phase 3 students to Rails, point out the main differences between Rails and Sinatra, and offer first hand experience and guidance to those making the switch from Sinatra to Rails. 

The Format
-------------
There are two sections to this prep: 
- [Overview](https://github.com/rguerrettaz/dev_bootcamp_phase3_prep/tree/master/overview)
- [Exercises](https://github.com/rguerrettaz/dev_bootcamp_phase3_prep/tree/master/exercises)

The overview briefly covers each of the main topics of concern in rails. The exercises give you a chance to get your hands dirty and see the topics in action.

The overview is to be read first. Any deviation from the path will end in <a  href="http://omgface.com/evil/evil%20baby7.jpg" target="_blank">death</a>....

My Motivation
-------------

After experiencing the seemingly mind shattering shift from Sinatra to Rails, I have decided to create a prep sheet for future [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) boots. The hope is that they will  escape my, and the many boots before me's, same frustrating fate (wondering wth is going on).


Contribution is Encouraged
-------------

For those who would be so kind to contribute to this project please fork, add changes, and do a pull request. The more input the merrier. Let's help give back to DBC and improve the experience and success of those coming after us.
