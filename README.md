Phase 3 Prep
========================

The main goal of this document is to introduce you to Rails, point out the main differences between Rails and Sinatra, and offer any possible guidance to those who will come after us. 

My Motivation
-------------

After experiencing the seemingly mind shattering shift from Sinatra to Rails I have decided to create a prep sheet for future Dev Bootcamp boots in hopes of their escaping experiencing my (and the many before me's) same fate. 


Forking is Encouraged
---------------------

For those who would be so kind to contribute to this project please fork, add changes, and do a pull request. The more input the merrier. Let's help give back to DBC and improve the experience and success of those coming after us.
